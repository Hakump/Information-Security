# Part A:

## Recovered password

## Pseudocode for attack

## Worst case running time

## Discussion merits of current proposal

## Suggestions for improvement


# Part B:

## Discussion of the current scheme
1. hashed value is not encrypted, so the integrity check is compromised
2. no length check

## Suggestions for improving the scheme
1. encrypt the hash
2. fix the length for all messages

# Extra Credit:

## Recovered password
Newm@dis0n
## Correct pseudocode
for (key in the library):
    hash key for 256 times:
	if hashed value == correct hash
	    return true
